			<div class="content"><p>I have always found a sense of humour helps, especially when talking about myself.</p>
				<p>I was born, like all people, great, small, both good and bad, at a very young age.</p>
				<p>I was raised in Porirua City (NZ), but now call Lower Hutt home.</p>
				<p>I have a keen interest in cooking, which I made a profession for 7 years but now it's back to a simple and humble joy of cooking for family and friends.</p>
				<p>While a chef, I cooked for lots of movie stars, I cooked on a deep sea vessel in the Southern Ocean and for the only tratorria to be featured in the<a href"http://www.amazon.com/The-Silver-Spoon-New-Edition/dp/0714862568">silver spoon</a> outside of Italy.</p>
				<p>This spurred another love of mine, gardening. Gardening is really the child of my love of ecology and my love of food, and goes right to the heart of my musing on "what's in the system? what's outside the system?" - which draws so much into itself,- I love to see the inter-connecteness of things.</p>
				<p>I studied science at school and for many years (12) I worked in Quality Assurance at a large manufacturer. I ended up in charge of the mainatence and implimentation of many of quality control systems and equipment as a "Non Tobacco Materials Quality Coordinator".</p>
				<p>I traveled extensively in my 20's, loved it. Fell in love with all the different ways people see the world, how they react to different and what they think is normal. Also fell in love with my S.O. which moves nicely over to my kids</p>
				<p>Life changer like none I'd known previous in those two words,  -"my kids". They mean everything to me, they are the reason, the focus and the center I now orbit. I've done everything I've ever wanted to in this world, set goals, climed mountains, changed bad habits into good, learned hard lessons from harder people, but compaired with the last three years since Amelia and then Maxwell came along, I relise that all that previous was just drops in the ocean compaired to what my life is like now.</p>
