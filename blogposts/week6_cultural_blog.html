			<div class="content"><p><h3>Stero Type Threat</h3>
			</p>
			<p>OK, this concept is a new to me and still zinging 'round me head so this will probably be a stream of conciousness rather than a long planned and well-thought-out thesis</p> 
			<p>At first I thought to myself, being a white male with blue eyes - oh right, this is a 'minority' thing, that it isn't really going to apply to me - I'm suppose to be part of the dominate culture, the invisible empire, <i>(with the world at my feet and sh1t that smells sweet)</i> due to the random accident we all go through called, "birth".</p> 
			<p>Then I read a bit further and thought, now wait a second, this may be applicable...</p>
			<p>You see, I'm not any good at any sport, not even a *little* bit, not by anyones imagination. From what egg was this injustice hatched? How did the world, or more to the point, how did <b>I</b> malign <b>myself</b> with this culturally unaccetable idiom? </p>
			<p>If we hot rewind on the clock around 30 years ago, we would find a skinny white boy with a snotty nose, no fear in those blue eyes and a strong need for peer acceptance and support.</p>
			<p>...on a rugby felid...</p>
			<p>...opposite a slightly larger Samoan boy who's name I forgot...</p>
			<p>...and every time he had the ball he walked over me without much change in speed, direction or momentum...</p>
			<p>...and I never quite got the change to return or repay that favour, fearless as I was at that age...</p>
			<p>...which irked me, sore as I was after that game, I turned to our captain and asked why he was so adamant in expressing to the team</p>
			<p>..."make sure Phillip doesn't get the ball"...</p>
			<p>Now, his answer to that question is lost in the sands of time and it is not important to this blogpost any further than to say that I believed his answer, to such an extent, that if I was to, -I would probably play rugby like an 8 year old. Witnessing the slight advantage at 8 turn into life threatening, backbreaking advantages by the time we were 13 only made this voice louder - "don't play sport you aren't good at sport".</p> 
			<p>For those of you querring how did one eight year olds opinions on one game of rugby balloon in to a manifested lack of ability in all sporting realms - that is in my undestanding called the <b>Stero Type Threat.</b></p>
			<p>It's a matter of <i>because I believe I'm not going to be as good as the next guy, I don't perform as well as I could.</i> It's similar to the way they train a small young elephant with a chain around it's ankle, it spends all of it's childhood trying to escape that chain. By the time the elephant is fully grown they can replace the chain with a bit of string, it stopped trying to win in that competition with the chain a long, long time a go.</p>
			<p>P.S. Even years later, and much practiced at pool, I still never managed to beat most of the Samoan's at work, becasue, ya know, "white boys aren't that good at sport."</p></div>
