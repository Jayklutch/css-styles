			<p>I would strongly agree with a statement that I try to live up to these values. It's not always possible to be <i>"everything and more"</i>, which is the "Just Man, who can stand upright before the Law/Lord", but I whole heartedly think that One can always try to be "everything and more". So that would be a 5 on the scale we have before us now. 5 for strongly agree that we *attempt* these things at all times.</p>
			<p><h3>Willpower</h3></p>
			<p>Willpower - I believe in a mind before matter universe, that there is no objective truth in this world, it being an illusion projected from a deeper and more true reality that our humble senses cannot begin to fathom, but that our imagination can. Willpower is important in this equation / paragdim as imagination is a flightly thing that jumps from one angle to another suppose and back to a spiral without any assistance. Help comes from willpower, which can direct and guide imagination. This allows our minds to contimplate a deeper and more truer sense of reality than is normally availible to the untrained mind.</p>
<p><h3>Advice</h3></p>
<p>The last thing that someone asked me for advice on was cooking. I gave the advice that I normally give in these situatons which is "If you thing it's the right thing to do, give it a go, <b>BUT</b>, remember what you were unsure of, what you did and what were/are the results from that action. Then next time and the time after, recall what you've did and let those results be your guide".</p>

<p><h3>How do you feel when you think about your values? Do you think it can help you mediate stereotype threat if you recognize you feel it?</h3></p>
<p>I feel positive when I think about my values as they are by-in-large a positive group of words and values. Although everything has a dark side, we are not looking at that side of the coin today. I do think that focusing on these positives can help me mediate sterotype threat if I recognised and felt it, but  I think that this would only come with time and repeated practice.</p>
<p><h3>Can you think of any other exercises you can use to help you when you are feeling down (for whatever reason) at EDA?</h3></p>
<p> I have carried <a href"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bene_Gesserit#Litany_against_fear">this</a> with me since I read it as a nine year old and it has helped me through many bad patches were I've feared for my life or just needed a boost:</p>
<div id "Bene"><p><i>I must not fear.</i></p>
<p><i>Fear is the mind-killer.</i></p>
<p><i>Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration.</i></p>
<p><i>I will face my fear.</i></p>
<p><i>I will permit it to pass over me and through me.</i></p>
<p><i>And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path.</i></p>
<p><i>Where the fear has gone there will be nothing.</i></p>
<p><i>Only I will remain</i></p></div>
<p></p></div>
