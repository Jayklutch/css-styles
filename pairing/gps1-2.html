      <h3>What is pair programming?</h3>
      <p>Pair programming is a process of writing code which allows for both 
      the overview and detail of the code to be monitored. It is made up of a 
      pair of coders with one being the driver and one being the navigator.</p>
      <h3>Why is pair programming important to EDA?</h3>
      <p>Pair programming is important to EDA because it reinforcese that good 
      code is written in teams not by indiviuals. It allows for bugs errors and 
      mistakes to be caught straight away.</p>
      <h3>Compare Driver and Navigator</h3>
      <p>The driver types and the navigators talks.</p>

    <div class="Content"><h3>Reflections</h3>
        <p>It's a lot faster to work out problems. Two minds are better than one at coding.
            We enjoyed it, it was good fun. What worked was getting a webpage together in an hour.
            We stumbled a bit with getting use to the new tools.
