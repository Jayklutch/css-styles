Phill's impressions of the dev academy culture.

Based from Sheereef's Fireside Chat

(Cult)ure, the art of being. 

- That's how I've always interpretated it anyway. 
What impressions do I have from the video clip 'Sheereef's Fireside Chat' about the culture at dev academy?
My first overwelming impression was one of a taosit framework incorparating the principles of hermactisim and alchemy. 

To break that down a little, the culture of "oh yucky there's a hair in my soup, wont someone take it out" -is quite rightly banished and reminds me of the taosit principle of the dao or the way - which is a way of living in acceptance that there is only the dichonomy of right and wrong in the human mind, not in nature. The Dao teaches there is only the way things are. 
This moves onto the second part of the complaint "wont someone take it out?" - My impression from Sheereef's talk that he expects the principles of Hermatic Alchemy to come into play here- Be self aware, Take control of your life and actions for the betterment of yourself first-most, and of everyone else by the default of you being a better person. 
(This is the philosphers stone capable of turning lead into gold and is represented best by the scupture 'the thinker')
I have the impression that turning lead into gold is one of the quests of dev academy and like building a pyramid, all tasks need to be broken into small perfectly shaped blocks, under the watchful eye (scope) inside a triangle (the three lines of quality, cost and time). Thats how you build.
Sheerfes also touched on the devils of "what if I am not good enough" and "what if im the best thing ever" and expressed a true framework for dealing with both these mind set - To either make them flexible and self aware enough that they are indeed just devils that need to be banished by instilling a flexibility of mind or completely exsorsized if that doesn't work.

I see myself interacting with this culture in any way that will be percieved as adding value. That value can't really be calculated until I find my feet but I think you'll find me adding value, unafraid to speak or shut up and an ability to learn from just about everything in the 100% focus that hindsight brings.

My expectations of dev academy haven't really changed at this juncture as I haven't yet seen enough repeating behaviour from the dev academy organisim to start predicting what will come next. 

Yes - I am excited. Yes - I'm nervous. And yes - I'm trying my best to not let either of these two things mess with my worldview and the tasks at hand.
