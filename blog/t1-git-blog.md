Explain how git tracks changes
Evaluate the benefits of using GitHub to store code

Intro
Well what a week it's been! I probably need some sleep, but how is that possible with so many cool concepts running through my head? I really thought my brain would fall apart earlier in the week - but never fear - it turns out it was just doing a bit of a re-formatting exersize to get some room organised for all this amazingly neat and cool coding I'm being taught.

Ok, this second paragraph is going to be all about something called version control.
Version control is a nessersary tool in developing code as it allows for some pretty neat things to occur and stops some pretty tedious things from also occuring. Version control keep the code being worked on in a 'central' location, visable to all the developers working on it. It allows those developers to take a copy of the code, called a branch, work on it, modify it, even delete it before uploading and joining it back to the source of that branch. Here is where it gets tricky - the development team can see who modified what and have the ability to disregard those chages and revert to the previous version. It also allows for different developers to work on different sections of the code simultaneously in a 'many hand make light work' sense. Without being able to monitor modifications and revert changes, developers would have to find bugs by examining the code slowly line by line, searching for what maybe only one small dash in the wrong place. ALso without version control the code would have to be written one line after the other making the process both inefficient and under-productive.


SO now that we know what version control is, I can explain how git tracks changes, (git is the version control we've using to learn at Dev Academy). The tracking of changes begins as soon as a branch has been 'added' - that a definetive term in git 'added' - It means that a branch has already been taken from the master code, that modifications have been performed on it and now it's ready to begin it's journey to rejoin it's maker. So we have a branch, it gets "added", this moves it to a staging area, (and means that git is now tracking any changes to it as an independant entity), so it's ready to be committed. The function called "commit" gets the file ready to be sent. Then the when the file is uploaded, gitHub recognises that this is it's own branch/entity and calls it a time for beddybye byes
