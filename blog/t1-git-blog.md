  blog template using HTML and CSS and you'll be able
  to copy and paste the blog posts from week 1 in there
  to make them pretty next week.

  For now, please replace the title, subtitle (if desired),
  and date with the text you would like. Markdown is pretty
  simple, so you can just feel free to type. =) You'll want

Intro
Well what a week it's been! I probably need some sleep, but how is that possible with so many cool concepts running through my head? I really thought my brain would fall apart earlier in the week - but never fear - it turns out it was just doing a bit of a re-formatting exersize to get some room organised for all this amazingly neat and cool coding I'm being taught.
