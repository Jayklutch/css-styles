I Am That I Code.

Phill's Learning To Code Blog.

Not so long ago and in pretty close geographical posistion.
(Think - 8/11/14 - Petone)

Well what a week it's been! I think I should really have a sleep before I stray too far into this weekly blog summary, but how?  How? - Although the week started really heavy by having to learn powershell, I feel like I have worked hard enough to enjoy a bit of a coast, so here I am, one unfinished blog post down and 24hrs to get it chopped cleaned and done in a more professional manner. Prep is the key. Mise en place.
